    <h2>Games &amp; Sports</h2>
    <p>
      At its heart, The Weekend Olympic Showdown of Massive Proportions is an Olympic-style
      competition staged between new and old friends in events known as <strong>faux sports</strong>.
      These sports are completely new games imagined by the event organizers or modified
      versions of classic games with new twists and challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each WOSoMP olympiad acts as its own stand-alone tournament, in which athletes and their
      teams compete in individual and team sports in the quest for medals. Typically, an olympiad
      offers between seven and ten sports to its competitors, spread near-equally between
      individual skill challenges and team competitions.

    <h2>Your Team is Your Country</h2>
    <p>
      Like the Olympics, each athlete represents a home team. When registerring for each WOSoMP
      event, athletes select or form a team of their choice and recruit friends and family to join
      them. During the games, they'll wear the colors of their home team as they play throughout
      the day, and the points each athlete earns affect the outcome of the team championship.
    </p>
    <p>
      For competition sports, athletes will form smaller groups formed from players on their parent
      team, so choosing a fun and capable team is an important factor in overall success.

    <h2>Why Does it Cost Money?</h2>
    <p>
      Putting together a WOSoMP Olympiad requires efforts as far ranging as designing new sports
      and coordinating registration, uniform orders, equipment, and refreshments for dozens of
      athletes and fans.
    </p>
    <p>
      WOSoMP is a non-profit event. Registration costs go directly to providing athletes with
      customized, team-specific uniforms, sporting equipment, awards and medals, and refreshments
      including water, beer, and food. Past events have operated at a small loss in order to keep
      fees paid by participants as low as possible.

      The first WOSoMP event was held in September 2007 in Branchburg, NJ. The tournament
      offered nine sports, including Xtreme Air Hockey, Homemade Disc Golf, Beotch Ball,
      Boomshakalaka Ball, and more.

    <p>
      Athletes and teams compete for medals, which are awarded for performance in every event.
      Also, trophies are awarded to the Best Overall Athletes, both male and female. Teams are
      competing, on the efforts of their member athletes, to win the Championship Trophy, awarded
      to the team with the best overall combined performance during the olympiad.
